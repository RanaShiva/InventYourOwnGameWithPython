<h1>HOW TO PLAY!!</h1>
This Folder contains a game that I learned from <strong>Sir Al Sweigart</strong> through his book- <i>"Invent your own Computer games with python"</i>.<br>
I did tweaked the code a little to make a different kind of game.<br>
(1)-To see the source code see the <i>jokes.py</i> file.<br>
(2)-To play the game download <i>jokes.exe</i> file from the same folder to your computer.
Double click the file to enjoy!!
<br>Any comments are most welcomed.
<br><strong>Thanks for your time!</strong>
