This Folder contains a game that I learned from Sir Al Sweigart through his Book "Invent your game with python".
I did tweaked the code a little to make a different kind of game.
To see the source code see the dragon.py file.
To play the game download dragon.exe file from the same folder to your computer.
Double click the file to enjoy!!
Any comments are most welcomed.
Thanks for your time!
