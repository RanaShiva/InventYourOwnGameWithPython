<h1>HOW TO PLAY!!</h1>
This Folder contains a game that I learned from **Sir Al Sweigart** through his book- *"Invent your own games with python"*.<br>
I did tweaked the code a little to make a different kind of game.<br>
(1)-To see the source code see the *dragon.py* file.<br>
(2)-To play the game download *dragon.exe* file from the same folder to your computer.
Double click the file to enjoy!!
<br>Any comments are most welcomed.
<br>**Thanks for your time!**
