This Folder contains a game that I learned from <strong>Sir Al Sweigart</strong> through his book- <i>"Invent your own game with python"</i>.</br>
I did tweaked the code a little to make a different kind of game.</br>
(1)-To see the source code see the dragon.py file.</br>
(2)-To play the game download dragon.exe file from the same folder to your computer.
Double click the file to enjoy!!
</br>Any comments are most welcomed.
</br><strong>Thanks for your time!</strong>
